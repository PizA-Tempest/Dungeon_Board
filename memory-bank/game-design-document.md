# Game Design Document — Dungeon Board

## Core Feeling

Dungeon Board should feel chaotic, exciting, and social.

Players experience the thrill of dice rolls, sudden reversals, clever plays, and unexpected outcomes. Strategy matters, but luck and timing keep every match fresh and fun.

The game should never feel heavy or exhausting—every turn should create tension, laughter, or anticipation.

## Game Fantasy

Players are adventurers trapped inside a living dungeon that exists as a giant board.

Every step forward is decided by fate:

* monsters attack
* treasures empower
* traps punish
* rivals interfere

The dungeon rewards the bold and punishes the careless. Only one adventurer can dominate the board and claim victory.

## Target Players

* Casual and mid-core players
* Friends playing together in private rooms
* Solo players who enjoy AI-controlled opponents
* Fans of:

  * D&D-style fantasy
  * board games
  * party games
  * replayable strategy

Players must log in before playing, creating identity and continuity across sessions.

## Player Experience

A typical session:

* Player logs in
* Creates or joins a room
* Chooses race and class
* Plays a full match in a single sitting
* Experiences rivalry, chaos, and progression
* Leaves with a memorable story from the match

Bots ensure the game is always playable, even solo.

## Project Goals

Dungeon Board must:

* Support 1–4 players per room
* Allow friend invites and bot fill-in
* Use board-based movement and dice
* Include 8 classes and 8 races (mix & match)
* Deliver a complete, playable MVP

Success is defined by fun, clarity, and replayability—not system complexity.
