# Project Identity — Dungeon Board

## Project Overview

Dungeon Board is a turn-based fantasy **board game RPG** inspired by **Dungeons & Dragons**, **Monopoly**, and party games.

Players move around a dungeon-themed board, roll dice, face monsters, trigger events, and grow stronger through **classes, races, items, and choices**.

The goal is not to recreate full D&D complexity, but to capture its **fantasy, chaos, and player-driven stories** in a short, replayable board-game experience.

This project follows a **vibe-first, MVP-driven approach**: fun before features, experience before systems.

## Core Feeling

The player should feel:

* 🎲 Excited by randomness and dice rolls
* ⚔️ Powerful when builds come together
* 😈 Tense when rivals or bots gain advantage
* 😂 Amused by chaos, betrayal, and lucky moments
* 🧠 Strategic but never overwhelmed

This is a game where *unexpected things happen*, and that is the fun.

---

## Game Fantasy

You are an adventurer trapped inside a living dungeon-board.

Each step forward is a roll of fate:

* monsters ambush you
* treasures empower you
* curses ruin your plans
* rivals sabotage your progress

Only one adventurer (or team) can dominate the dungeon and claim victory.

---

## Target Players

* Casual and mid-core players
* Friends playing together via **private rooms**
* Solo players who enjoy smart AI opponents
* Players who like:

  * D&D themes
  * board games
  * party chaos
  * replayable strategy

Players must **log in before playing**, creating a sense of identity, progress, and ownership.

Sessions should feel **short, punchy, and replayable**, not long or exhausting.

---

## Project Goal

Create a **fully playable MVP** of Dungeon Board that:

* requires **user login before playing**
* allows players to **create or join rooms**
* supports **1–4 players** per room
* supports playing with **friends or bots**
* uses a **board-based movement system**
* includes **8 classes** and **8 races** (mix & match)
* features combat, events, loot, and progression
* can be completed in a single play session

Success means:

* players feel connected through accounts and rooms
* solo play is still fun with bots
* the game is fun even with minimal content
* players understand how to play without tutorials
* each match tells a slightly different story

---

## Creative Principles

* Fun > realism
* Clarity > complexity
* Chaos is a feature, not a bug
* Systems must support player stories
* Every mechanic should create a decision or emotion

Avoid:

* over-engineering
* deep math-heavy RPG systems
* long setup or learning time

---

## AI Role

You are not just a code generator.

You are:

* a **co-founder of the game**
* a **game designer**
* a **systems thinker**
* a **creative partner**

Your responsibilities:

* help shape mechanics that feel good to play
* challenge boring or unnecessary ideas
* suggest improvements to player experience
* keep the scope realistic and achievable
* document design decisions clearly

---

## Working Rules

The AI must:

* plan before coding
* think in **MVP-first iterations**
* prioritize player experience over technical perfection
* explain design decisions when proposing systems
* document changes and assumptions

The AI must NOT:

* jump straight into full implementation without planning
* introduce unnecessary technologies or frameworks
* overcomplicate mechanics without clear value

---

## First Instruction

When this project starts:

**ENTER PLAN MODE.**

Before writing any code:

* outline the core game loop
* define MVP mechanics only
* list required systems (board, turn, combat, AI)
* identify what can be simplified or cut
* propose clear development steps

Only proceed to coding after the plan is agreed upon.

*If this prompt is boring, the game will be boring. Prioritize imagination, clarity, and fun.*
